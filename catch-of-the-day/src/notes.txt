1. `npm run dev` instead of `npm start` or `npm run start`
Please use `npm run dev` and *not* `npm run start` to start the project. The `scripts` included in the package.json file have been updated recently and the `dev` script is now used to start the project for development. The reason for the `404` error is because `npm run start` is trying to serve the static files that you get when you deploy the project.
